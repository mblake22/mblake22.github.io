	<p id="body">This website was created by me, Mason Blake, and I am a senior at St. Michael-Albertville High School. This website is my final project for Mr. Osowski's Web Page Design class.I used Adobe Dreamweaver to create this website including HTML, CSS, and Java scripts. I love air planes and helicopters and decided to use the Huey, one of my favorite helicopters, as the topic of my final project. </p>
